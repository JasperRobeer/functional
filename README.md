# Toy Functional Programming Language

A type system for a functional toy language, inspired by the course on compiler
construction that I followed at [Utrecht University](http://foswiki.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/Cco),
and the writings of [Stephen Diehl](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/006_hindley_milner.html).

The type inference system is built on the Hindley-Milner type system.

## Building and Running

Building the functional toy language requires [stack](https://haskellstack.org).

Run `stack build` to build the project.
